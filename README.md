## Contributing

### Suggestions and updates

These guidelines are a work in progress for packages contributed to the rOpenSci suite. Corrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issue submissions in this repository](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dev_guide/issues/new). Open discussions are welcome in our [forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/). You can also make a pull request, please edit the .Rmd files that are at the root of this repository. The book will be built and automatically deployed when your PR is merged.

### Technical details

Deployment is done via Travis CI using the rOpenSci [`tic`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic) and [`travis`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/travis) packages: whenever there's a push to master, the book is built on Travis to a _book folder whose content is then pushed from Travis to the gh-pages branch. We use the setup of [the example repo of a bookdown deployed with Travis](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.bookdown/). RSA keys were created and stored in the right places using `travis::use_travis_deploy`.

If you're an associate editor, you can also push directly to master for small fixes. We can use PRs for discussing larger updates.

If you're an associate editor and you want to render the book locally you need to install `bookdown` and the other dependencies stated in [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) in particular use `devtools::install_github("bergant/airtabler")`, and get and store an Airtable API key following [there instructions](https://github.com/bergant/airtabler#get-and-store-the-api-key) (if you're not an editor, you don't have access to our Airtable base). Then use `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')` and the book will be generated in an _output folder.
