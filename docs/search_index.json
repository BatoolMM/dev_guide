To ensure a consistent style across all of our tools we have developed this concise guide. We strongly recommend that package developers read Hadley Wickham’s concise but thorough book on package development which is available for free online (and print). 1.1 Package naming We strongly recommend short, descriptive names in lower case. If your package deals with one or more commercial services, please make sure the name does not violate branding guidelines. You can check if your package name is available, informative and not offensive by using the available package. 1.2 Function/variable naming &amp; general syntax We strongly recommend snake_case over all other styles unless you are porting over a package that is already in wide use. Avoid function name conflicts with base packages or other popular ones (e.g. ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr, data.table) Consider an object_verb() naming scheme for functions in your package that take a common data type or interact with a common API. object refers to the data/API and verb the primary action. This scheme helps avoid namespace conflicts with packages that may have similar verbs, and makes code readable and easy to auto-complete. For instance, in stringi, functions starting with stri_ manipulate strings (stri_join(), stri_sort(), and in googlesheets functions starting with gs_ are calls to the Google Sheets API (gs_auth(), gs_user(), gs_download()). For functions that manipulate an object/data and return an object/data of the same type, make the object/data the first argument of the function so as to enhance compatibility with the pipe operator (%&gt;%) For more information on how to style your code, name functions, and R scripts inside the R/ folder, we recommend reading the code chapter in Hadley’s book. 1.3 README All packages should have a README file, named README.md, in the root of the repository. The README should include, from top to bottom (see this example): * The package name * Badges for continuous integration and test coverage, the badge for rOpenSci peer-review once it has started (see below), and any other badges * Short description of the package * Installation instructions * Brief demonstration usage * If applicable, how the package compares to other similar packages and/or how it relates to other packages * Citation information Once you have submitted a package and it has passed editor checks, add a peer-review badge via [![](https://badges.ropensci.org/&lt;issue_id&gt;_status.svg)](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/&lt;issue_id&gt;) where issue_id is the number of the issue in the onboarding repository. For instance, the badge for rtimicropem review uses the number 126 since it’s the review issue number. The badge will first indicated “under review” and then “peer-reviewed” once your package has been onboarded, and will link to the review issue. If your package connects to a data source or online service, or wraps other software, consider that your package README may be the first point of entry for users. It should provide enough information for users to understand the nature of the data, service, or software, and provide links to other relevant data and documentation. For instance, a README should not merely read, “Provides access to GooberDB,” but also include, “…, an online repository of Goober sightings in South America. More information about GooberDB, and documentation of database structure and metadata can be found at link. We recommend not creating README.md directly, but from a README.Rmd file (an Rmarkdown file) if you have any demonstration code. The advantage of the .Rmd file is you can combine text with code that can be easily updated whenever your package is updated. Extensive examples should be kept for a vignette. If you want to make the vignettes more accessible before installing the package, we suggest creating a website for your package with pkgdown. Here is a good tutorial to get started with pkgdown. Consider using devtools::use_readme_rmd() to get a template for a README.Rmd file and to automatically set up a pre-commit hook to ensure that README.md is always newer than README.Rmd. After a package is accepted, the rOpenSci footer should be added to the bottom of the README file with the following markdown line: [![ropensci_footer](http://ropensci.org/public_images/github_footer.png)](http://ropensci.org) See the gistr README for a good example README to follow. 1.4 Documentation All exported package functions should be fully documented with examples. The package should contain top-level documentation for ?foobar, (or ?foobar-package if there is a naming conflict). Optionally, you can use both ?foobar and ?foobar-package for the package level manual file, using @aliases roxygen tag. The package should contain at least one vignette providing an introduction to the primary package functions and use-cases. As is the case for a README, top-level documentation or vignettes may be the first point of entry for users. If your package connects to a data source or online service, or wraps other software, it should provide enough information for users to understand the nature of the data, service, or software, and provide links to other relevant data and documentation. For instance, a the vignette intro or documentation should not merely read, “Provides access to GooberDB,” but also include, “…, an online repository of Goober sightings in South America. More information about GooberDB, and documentation of database structure and metadata can be found at link. We strongly encourage all submissions to use roxygen2 for documentation. roxygen2 is an R package that automatically compiles .Rd files to your man folder in your package from simple tags written above each function. More information on using roxygen2 documentation is available on the R packages book. One key advantage of using roxygen2 is that your NAMESPACE will always be automatically generated and up to date. When using roxygen2, add #' @noRd to internal functions. 1.5 Authorship The DESCRIPTION file of a package should list package authors and contributors to a package, using the Authors@R syntax to indicate their roles (author/creator/contributor etc.) if there is more than one author. See this section of “Writing R Extensions” for details. If you feel that your reviewers have made a substantial contribution to the development of your package, you may list them in the Authors@R field with a Reviewer contributor type (&quot;rev&quot;), like so: person(&quot;Bea&quot;, &quot;Hernández&quot;, role = &quot;rev&quot;, comment = &quot;Bea reviewed the package for ropensci, see &lt;https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/116&gt;&quot;), Only include reviewers after asking for their consent. Note that ‘rev’ will raise a CRAN NOTE unless the package is built using R v3.5 (r-devel as of 2017-09-21). Please do not list editors as contributors. Your participation in and contribution to rOpenSci is thanks enough. 攼㹤愼㸰戼㹤攼㹤戼㸹㠼㸲 1.6 Testing All packages should pass R CMD check/devtools::check() on all major platforms. All packages should have a test suite that covers major functionality of the package. We recommend using testthat for writing tests. Strive to write tests as you write each new function. This serves the obvious need to have proper testing for the package, but allows you to think about various ways in which a function can fail, and to defensively code against those. More information. testthat has a function skip_on_cran() that you can use to not run tests on CRAN. We recommend using this on all functions that are API calls since they are quite likely to fail on CRAN. These tests will still run on Travis. Check the extent of your test coverage using the covr package. Including a coverage badge in your package’s README makes it easy for reviewers to see how well-tested your package is. 100% coverage is not required, but editors and reviewers will use coverage reports as a starting point to evaluate that your test suite covers the important functionality of your package. Even if your use continuous integration, we recommend that you run tests locally prior to submitting your package, as some tests are often skipped. (You may need to set Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN=&quot;true&quot;) in order to ensure all tests are run.) In addition, we recommend that prior to submitting your package, you use Gabor Csardi’s goodpractice package to check your package for likely sources of errors, and run devtools::spell_check() to find spelling errors in documentation. 1.7 Examples Include extensive examples in the documentation. In addition to demonstrating how to use the package, these can act as an easy way to test package functionality before there are proper tests. However, keep in mind we require tests in contributed packages. If you prefer not to clutter up code with extensive documentation, place further documentation/examples in files in a man-roxygen folder in the root of your package, and those will be combined into the manual file by the use of @template &lt;file name&gt;, for example. You can run examples with devtools::run_examples(). 1.8 Package dependencies Use Imports instead of Depends for packages providing functions from other packages. Make sure to list packages used for testing (testthat), and documentation (knitr, roxygen2) in your Suggests section of package dependencies. If you use any packages in your examples sections, make sure to list those, if not already listed elsewhere, in Enhances section of package dependencies. For most cases where you must expose functions from dependencies to the user, you should import and re-export those individual functions rather than listing them in the Depends fields. For instance, if functions in your package produce raster objects, you might re-export only printing and plotting functions from the raster package. 1.9 Recommended scaffolding For http requests we strongly recommend using httr over RCurl. For parsing JSON, use jsonlite instead of rjson or RJSONIO. For parsing, creating, and manipulating XML, we strongly recommend xml2 for most cases. 1.10 Console messages Use message() and warning() to communicate with the user in your functions. Please do not use print() or cat() unless it’s for a print.*() method, as these methods of printing messages are harder for the user to suppress. 1.11 Miscellaneous CRAN gotchas This is a collection of CRAN gotchas that are worth avoiding at the outset. Make sure your package title is in Title Case. Do not put a period on the end of your title Avoid starting the description with the package name or This package … Make sure you include links to websites if you wrap a web API, scrape data from a site, etc. in the Description field of your DESCRIPTION file Avoid long running tests and examples. Consider testthat::skip_on_cran in tests to skip things that take a long time but still test them locally and on Travis. Include top-level files such as paper.md, .travis.yml in your .Rbuildignore file. 1.12 Further guidance Hadley Wickham’s R Packages is an excellent, readable resource on package development and is available a a free book on the web. Writing R Extensions is the canonical, usually most up-to-date, reference for creating R packages. If you are submitting a package to rOpenSci via the onboarding repo, you can direct further questions to the rOpenSci team in the issue tracker, or in our discussion forum. "],
["continuous-integration-best-practices.html", "Chapter 2 Continuous Integration Best Practices 2.1 Continuous integration", " Chapter 2 Continuous Integration Best Practices Now I wonder if this is the best place since after onboarding things move. :thinking_face: That said the transfer will be part of the author guide. 2.1 Continuous integration All rOpenSci packages must use one form of continuous integration. This ensures that all commits, pull requests, and new branches are run through R CMD check. R is now a natively supported language on Travis-CI, making it easier than ever to do continuous integration. See R Packages and Julia Silge’s Beginner’s Guide to Travis-CI for R for more help. Travis offers continuous integration for Linux and Mac OSX. For continuous integration on Windows, see R + Appveyor. R packages that use compiled code or link to other libraries or languages should have CI for all platforms. R packages that use compiled code or link to other libraries or languages should have CI for all platforms. Continuous integration should also include reporting of test coverage via a testing service such CodeCov or Coveralls. See the README for the covr package for instructions, as well as devtools::use_coverage(). Both test status and code coverage should be reported via a badge in your package README. "],

Packages are reviewed for quality, fit, documentation, clarity and the review process is quite similar to a manuscript review (see our packaging guide and reviewing guide for more details). Unlike a manuscript review, this process will be an ongoing conversation. Once all major issues and questions, and those addressable with reasonable effort, are resolved, the editor assigned to a package will make a decision (accept, hold, or reject). Rejections are usually done early (before the review process begins), but in rare cases a package may also be rejected after review &amp; revision. 5.2 Aims and Scope rOpenSci aims to support packages that support reproducible research and managing the data lifecycle for scientists. Packages submitted to rOpenSci should fit into one or more of the following categories. If you are unsure whether your package fits into one of these categories, please open an issue as a pre-submission inquiry (Examples). As as this is a living document, these categories may change through time and not all previously onboarded packages would be in-scope today. While we strive to be consistent, we evaluate packages on a case-by-case basis and may make exceptions. 5.2.1 Package categories data retrieval: Packages for accessing and download data from online sources with scientific applications. Our definition of scientific applications is broad, including data storage services, journals, and other remote servers, as many data sources may be of interest to researchers. However, retrieval packages should be focused on data sources / topics, rather than services. For example a general client for Amazon Web Services data storage would not be in-scope. (Examples: rotl, gutenbergr) data extraction: Packages that aid in retrieving data from unstructured sources such as text, images and PDFs, as well as parsing scientific data types and outputs from scientific equipment. Statistical/ML libraries for modeling or prediction are typically not included in this category, but trained models that act as utilities (e.g., for optical character recognition), may qualify. (Examples: tabulizer, robotstxt, genbankr) database access: Bindings and wrappers generic database APIs (Example: rrlite) data munging: Packages for processing data from formats above. This area does not include broad data manipulations tools such as reshape2 or tidyr, but rather tools for handling data in specific scientific formats. (Example: plateR) data deposition*: Packages that support deposition of data into research repositories, including data formatting and metadata generation. (Examples EML) reproducibility*: Tools that facilitate reproducible research. This includes packages that facilitate use of version control, provenance tracking, automated testing of data inputs and statistical outputs, citation of software and scientific literature. It does not include general tools for literate programming (e.g., R markdown extensions not under the previous topics). (Example assertr) In addition, we have some specialty topics with a slightly broader scope. geospatial data: We accept packages focused on accessing geospatial data, manipulating geospatial data, and converting between geospatial data formats. (Example: rgeospatialquality, osmplotr). text analysis: We are currently piloting a sub-specialty area for text analysis which includes implementation of statistical/ML methods for analyzing or extracting text data. This does not include packages with new methods, but only implementation or wrapping of previously published methods. As this is a pilot, the scope for this area is not fully defined and we are still developing a reviewer base and process for this area. Please open a pre-submission inquiry if you are considering submitting a package that falls under this topic. 5.2.2 Other Scope Considerations Packages should be general in that they should solve a problem as broadly as possible while maintaining a coherent user interface and code base. For instance if several data sources use an identical API, we prefer a package that provides access to all the data sources, rather than just one. Here are some types of packages we are unlikely to accept: Packages that wrap or implement statistical or machine learning methods. We are not organized so as to review the correctness of these methods. (But see “text analysis”, above) Exploratory data analysis packages that visualize or summarize data. General workflow or package development support packages We encourage submitting packages not accepted to rOpenSci to submit to CRAN, BioConductor, as well as other R package development initiatives (e.g., cloudyr), and software journals such as JOSS, JSS, or the R journal. Note that not all packages developed internally by rOpenSci or through our events or collaborations are in-scope for onboarding process. 5.3 Package overlap rOpenSci encourages competition among packages, forking and re-implementation as they improve options of users overall. However, as we want packages in the rOpenSci suite to be our top recommendations for the tasks they perform, we aim to avoid duplication of functionality of existing R packages in any repo without significant improvements. An R package that replicates the functionality of an existing R package may be considered for inclusion in the ROpenSci suite if it significantly improves on alternatives in any repository (RO, CRAN, BioC) by being: More open in licensing or development practices. Broader in functionality (e.g., providing access to more data sets, providing a greater suite of functions), but not only by duplicating additional packages Better in usability and performance Actively maintained while alternatives are poorly or no longer actively maintained These factors should be considered as a whole to determine if the package is a significant improvement. A new package would not meet this standard only by following our package guidelines while others do not, unless this leads to a significant difference in the areas above. We recommend that packages highlight differences from and improvements over overlapping packages in their README and/or vignettes. We encourage developers whose packages are not accepted due to overlap to still consider submittal to other repositories or journals. 5.4 Role of the rOpenSci leadership team Package authors will continue to maintain and develop their software after acceptance into rOpenSci. Unless explicitly added as collaborators, rOpenSci’s staff will not interfere much with day to day operations. However, this team may intervene with critical bug fixes, or address urgent issues if package authors do not respond in a timely manner. 5.5 Ownership of packages Authors of contributed packages essentially maintain the same ownership they had prior to their package joining the rOpenSci suite. Contributors will have write access to their repositories, but will need an rOpenSci staff member to add any new contributors. 5.6 Package removal In the unlikely scenario that a contributor of a package requests removal of their package from the suite, we retain the right to maintain a version of the package in our suite for archival purposes. 5.7 Quality commitment rOpenSci strives to develop and promote high quality research software. To ensure that your software meets our criteria, we review all of our submissions as part of the onboarding process, and even after acceptance will continue to chime in with improvements and bug fixes. Despite our best efforts to support contributed software, errors are the responsibility of individual maintainers. Buggy, unmaintained software may be removed from our suite at any time. 5.8 Maintainer responsiveness If package maintainers do not respond in a timely manner to requests for package fixes from CRAN or from us, we will remind the maintainer a number of times, but after 3 months (or shorter time frame, depending on how critical the fix is) we will make the changes ourselves. The above is a bit vague, so the following are a few areas of consideration. Examples where we’d want to move quickly: Package foo is depended on by 1 or more packages on CRAN, and foo is broken, and thus would break its reverse dependencies. Package bar may not have reverse dependencies on CRAN, but is widely used, thus quickly fixing problems is of greater importance. Examples where we can wait longer: Package hello is not on CRAN, or on CRAN, but has no reverse dependencies. Package world needs some fixes. The maintainer has responded but is simply very busy with a new job, or other reason, and will attend to soon. We urge package maintainers to make sure they are receiving GitHub notifications, as well as making sure emails from rOpenSci staff and CRAN maintainers are not going to their spam box. In addition, join the rOpenSci Slack https://ropensci.signup.team/ to chat to rOpenSci staff and the greater rOpenSci community. Should authors abandon the maintenance of an actively used package in our suite, we will consider petitioning CRAN to transfer package maintainer status to rOpenSci. 5.9 Code of Conduct We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic. Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups. Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us at info@ropensci.org immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back. Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior are not welcome. Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining code (e.g. “When the developer”) This CoC adapted from the io.js CoC, adapted from Rust’s CoC. "],
