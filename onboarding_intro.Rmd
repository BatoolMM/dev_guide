# Onboarding, Why? What?

Intro to onboarding.

Explain roles.

Include links to talks, and link to the blog post tag corresponding to posts about onboarding.

All packages contributed by community members go through a process of [open peer review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review) to ensure a consistent level of quality
for our users. This process also allows us to ensure that any new package meets
our guidelines and provides opportunity for discussion where exceptions are
requested.

## Why submit your package to rOpenSci?

-   First, and foremost, we hope you submit your package for review **because you
    value the feedback**.  We aim to provide useful feedback to package authors
    and for our review process to be open, non-adversarial, and focused on
    improving software quality.
-   Once aboard, your package will continue to receive **support from rOpenSci
    members**.  You'll retain ownership  and control of of your package, but we
    can help with ongoing maintenance issues such as those associated with
    updates to R and dependencies and CRAN policies.
-   rOpenSci will **promote your package** through our [web
    page](https://ropensci.org/packages/), [blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/),
    and [social media](https://twitter.com/ropensci).  Packages in our suite
    are also distributed via our [drat repository](http://packages.ropensci.org/)
    and [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/ropensci/), and listed
    in our [task views](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aropensci+%22task+view%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).
-   rOpenSci **packages can be cross-listed** with other repositories such as CRAN
    and BioConductor.
-   rOpenSci packages that contain a short accompanying paper can, after review,
    be automatically submitted to the
    [Journal of Open-Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) for fast-tracked
    publication.

## Why review packages for rOpenSci?

-   As in any peer-review process, we hope you choose to review **to give back
    to the rOpenSci and scientific communities.**  Our mission to expand
    access to scientific data and promote a culture of reproducible research
    is only possible through the volunteer efforts of community members like you.
-   Review is a two-way conversation. By reviewing packages, you'll have the
    chance to **continue to learn development practices from authors and
    other reviewers**.
-   The open nature of our review process allows you to **network and meet
    colleagues and collaborators** through the review process.  Our community
    is friendly and filled with supportive members expert in R development and
    many other areas of science and scientific computing.
-   To volunteer to be one of our reviewers, just click [here](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) to fill out a short form providing your contact
information and areas or expertise. We
    are always looking for more reviewers with both general package-writing experience
    and domain expertise in the fields packages are used for.

## Editors and reviewers

### Reviewers

We are grateful to the following individuals who have offered up their time and expertise to review packages submitted to rOpenSci.

```{r reviewers, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library("airtabler")
editors <- c("Noam Ross", "Scott Chamberlain", "Karthik Ram", "Maëlle Salmon")
reviewers <- air_get(base = "appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", table = "Reviewers", combined_result = FALSE)
reviewers2 <- air_get(base = "appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", table = "Reviewers", combined_result = FALSE, offset=get_offset(reviewers))
reviewers <- rbind(reviewers$fields[, c('name', 'github', 'Reviews')], reviewers2$fields[, c('name', 'github', 'Reviews')])
reviewers <- reviewers[purrr::map_lgl(reviewers$Reviews, ~!is.null(.)) & !(reviewers$name %in% c(editors, "???")), ]
reviewers <- reviewers[order(reviewers$name), ]
cat(paste0("[", reviewers$name, "](https://github.com/", reviewers$github, ")", collapse = " \U00B7 "))
```
